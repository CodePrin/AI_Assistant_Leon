# AI Assistant Leon
In this project, I created an AI assistant using the foundational concepts of Data Science, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing with the help of Python. I gave the name to my assistant as 'Leon'.

## Project Title
To create an AI assistant using the foundational concepts of Data Science, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing with the help of Python.

## Tools 
Used Python 3.11.1 for this project and below given packages:
* pyttsx3
* PyTorch
* SpeechRecognition
* Numpy
* nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
* wikipedia
* pywhatkit

## Files
This repository contains nine files other than README.md file, which are as follows:
* **Speak.py:** It is a python file that contains the say function for speaking the text.
* **Listen.py:** It is a python file that contains a listen function for hearing the input given by us.
* **Brain.py:** It is a python file that contains the code for structuring and functioning of the neural network of the AI assistant.
* **NeuralNetworks.py:** It is a python file that contains code for the working functions of the neural networks.
* **Train.py:** It is a python file consisting the functioning that how the assitant need to be trained.
* **Task.py:** It is a python file that contains the input and non-input execution functions for date, day and time generation and for searching on google and wikipedia.
* **Intents.json:** It is a json file that conntains the data saved by us, for training the assistant.
* **Leon.py:** It is the main file of our AI assistant where all the data is intrconnected for running synchronously with each other.
* **TrainData.pth:** A .pth file is a machine learning model created using PyTorch. It contains all the data related to the training.

## Results
Leon AI-Assistant is created.
